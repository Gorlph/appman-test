The explanations about some details of a card are very confusing. They are Strength, Weakness and Damage.


    HP level calculation maximum is 100. if value is higher than 100 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
    Strength level calculation multiply by 50, maximum is 100. e.g. if value is 1 set it to 50, 2 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
    Weakness level calculation multiply by 100, maximum is 100. e.g. if value is 1 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
    Damage calculation attacks damage value without symbol. e.g. 50+ set it to 50, 20* set it to 20, otherwise 0.
    Happiness level calculation ((hp / 10) + (damage /10 ) + 10 - (weak)) / 5


Pikachu {
  name: 'Pikachu',
  hp: 110,
  attacks: [
    { name: 'attack A', damage: '20+'},
    { name: 'attack B', damage: '40x'}
  ],
  weaknesses: [
    { name: 'weakness A'},
  ]
}

Output {
  hp: 100,
  atk: '100%',
  weak: '50%',
  damage: 60,
  level: 5
}

The only way I can make sense out of this example is that I am supposed to multiply 50 to the length of attacks array to get atk, 100 to the length of weaknesses array to get weak,
and take the sum of the damage of each attack into damage.

I would like to suggest to change the description of str, damage and weak to this:
"Strength level calculation: multiply the number of attacks by 50, maximum is 100. e.g. if the number of attacks is 1 set it to 50, 2 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
Weakness level: multiply the number of weaknesses by 100, maximum is 100. e.g. if value is 1 set it to 100, otherwise 0.
Damage calculation calculation: sum the damage of every attack without a trailing symbol. e.g. 50+ set it to 50, 20* set it to 20, otherwise 0."
